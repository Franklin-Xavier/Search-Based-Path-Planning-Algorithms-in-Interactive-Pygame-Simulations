# Search-Based-Path-Planning-Algorithms-in-Interactive-Pygame-Simulations
This project implements and compares BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, A*, and Bidirectional A* algorithms within interactive Pygame simulations, focusing on their application in robotic search and navigation tasks.

# Credits
This project is based on the work of ranjian0(https://github.com/ranjian0/A-star-Pathfinding). Special thanks to the original author for their contributions.

# Requirements
1. python 3.5+
2. pygame 1.9+

# Instructions
1. Left Click: Place the agent on the desired location.
2. Right Click: Position the target at the desired destination.
3. Middle Click: Introduce obstacles to shape the environment.
4. Spacebar: Initiate the navigation process.
5. 'R' Key: Reset the simulation for adjustments and a fresh start.
